🚀 A lightweight, voice‑controlled personal assistant written in Python. It listens to your commands, speaks back, and can perform basic tasks like opening websites, telling the time, playing random music from a folder, and greeting you based on the time of day. Built with `speech_recognition` and `pyttsx3`.

## 💡 About the Project

This project is a beginner‑friendly introduction to building a voice‑controlled assistant using Python. It leverages speech_recognition to capture and interpret user commands, and pyttsx3 for text‑to‑speech output. The assistant can greet the user based on the time of day, open popular websites, tell the current time, play a random song from a directory, and gracefully exit. The code is well‑structured and easy to extend – you can add new commands by simply adding more if-elif blocks.
